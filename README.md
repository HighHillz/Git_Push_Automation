# Git Push Automation
## What is it?
A terminal-based Python tool that handles all the necessary Git commands to push your code to GitHub safely and smoothly. Itâ€™s designed to simplify the most common headaches faced by both beginners and seasoned developers using Git.

With this tool, you donâ€™t need to memorize a long list of Git commands or fear making mistakes â€” itâ€™s got your back.

Handles common issues like:
- Invalid or incomplete Git commands
- Missing or non-Git directories
- Forgetting to add/stage files
- Empty commits / Clean working tree
- Active rebase states
- Merge conflicts
- Detached HEAD state
- Switching or creating branches
- Pulling with rebase before pushing

All you have to do is enter:
- Your GitHub repository name (Create it manully if it does not exist)
- Your local project folder  
- A commit message  

And just like that â€” your project is up on GitHub!

```

## How to Run
- First of all, ensure that the latest version of Python and git are installed.
- Make sure you generate a personal access token (PAT) from GitHub.
- Create a .env file with the following structure:
```bash
GITHUB_USERNAME=your_username
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_pat
BASE_PROJECTS_PATH=C:/Your/Path/To/Coding/Projects
```
- To start the application, run the `automate.py` file.

## Inspiration
I built this tool because pushing code with Git used to feel like a boss battle - especially when I was just starting out. Typos, forgotten stages, pull issues, rebase confusion â€” it was a lot.

So instead of wrestling with Git every time, I created a Python script that could handle it all for me. Now itâ€™s smooth, error-proof, and beginner-friendly. Plus, it helps you focus more on building and less on debugging your Git workflow.
